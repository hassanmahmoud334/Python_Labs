"""
Polymorphism in Python
----------------------

Definition:
    - "Poly" = many, "morph" = forms â†’ Many forms / many faces.
    - A concept where a single interface (same name) can be applied to different types.

Types of Polymorphism:
    1. Method Overloading:
        - Python does NOT support traditional overloading (like Java, C++).
        - Achieved using default arguments, *args, **kwargs.

    2. Method Overriding (via Inheritance):
        - Subclass redefines a method from its superclass.

    3. Operator Overloading:
        - Redefining operators like +, -, *, / using dunder methods:
            __add__, __iadd__, __sub__, __mul__, __lt__, __gt__, etc.

    4. Duck Typing:
        - "If it walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, it's probably a duck."
        - Python focuses on what an object *can do*, not its type.
        - Example: functions that expect any object with a `quack()` method.
